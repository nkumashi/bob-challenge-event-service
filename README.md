# Event-Service

This service is responsible for listening to the events generated by [`employee-service`](https://github.com/takeaway/bob-challenge-employee-service) and saving them in its own database. The [`event-service`](https://github.com/takeaway/bob-challenge-event-service/) must also expose a `REST API` that contains just one endpoint:
   - Get all events related to a specific employee in ascending order, i.e, _the oldest event must appear first_. Response should be in JSON Array format.
